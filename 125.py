"""
There is a file which contains temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit, one string per line. The strings are expected to look like this: 10F of -15C.

Write a Python program which asks:

the user for an input value for the file location

reads the file line by line

converts each temperature to Fahrenheit

writes the converted values in a new file

The input and output values should be floating-point numbers.
